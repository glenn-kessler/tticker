tticker is a simple time-tracker

seperate recurring tasks can be tracked over a period of a week
each tick represents a pre-defined timespan
from experience during studying, 30 minuntes are a good value for one tick

Left-click into a random field of the tticker, and a tick will be added to that particular field.
Right-click into that very field, and a tick will be removed, down to zero ticks.
